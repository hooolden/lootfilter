## Holden's Modified NeverSink LootFilter ##

**Based on the very strict version of NeverSink's lootfilter**
**Updated for 3.0** 
**I have no idea how you got here, but feel free to use this thing I guess.** 
**All work is property of NeverSink - I think what I did is legal, but if not I'll pull this down.**

I disagreed with some of the stuff that was showing up in this filter, and some of the sizes that it was showing up.  
I shrunk a lot of font sizes and hid everything that I didn't want to pick up.  
I love the format, sounds, and color scheme of NeverSink, so I stuck with his model.  

Questions:  @Holden in game.
